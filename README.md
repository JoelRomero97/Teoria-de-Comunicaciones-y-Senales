# Teoría de Comunicaciones y Señales

Implementations in C language of sampling, conditioning and signal processing, as well as frequency analysis to recognize vowels or pressed numbers on a phone

Signals are everywhere, examples of these are: Music, Videos, Electricity, our heart, brain, etc. That's why, is important to understand them how do they work.

This repository contains some applications with signals showing the sampling and processing of them to build useful applications.
For example, low - pass filter (applying Discrete convolution), reduce the volume or recognize vowels with Discrete convolution, Discrete Fourier Transofrm (DFT), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
